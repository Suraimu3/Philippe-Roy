            <p class="aboutText"> Thank you for taking the time to look at this portfolio of mine!<br><br>
                My first ambitious pursuits started with making AMVs (Animated Music Videos), which were mash-ups of catchy music and Anime. During that time I learned a lot about editing, and general computer skills as this was a time before YouTube and a lot had to be done manually to compress, and host videos online.<br><br>
                I continued onto college working with traditional mediums such as charcoal and was mainly doing realistic work based on observation. At some point after leaving school, I dug deep into exploring my style with abstraction, and eventually joined in the trend of making animated gifs. I also started drawing more with digital mediums when I bought my first Wacom, and when the iPad came out.<br><br>
                Recently, I decided to go back to school to hone the digital tools I have gathered. The animations I once did frame-by-frame with Flash, are now being created with After Effects.<br><br>
                If I was to write an Artist Statement, it would essentially be a point on the Elements of Art: Line, Shape, Color, Value, Texture, Form, Space, and Motion. Whatever I make, in my mind, I am thinking how it is representative of a combination of those elements.<br><br>
                If you would like to email me: proylineone@gmail.com. There is Instagram as well: @astropip. If curious for more, also visit my blog at Tumblr. It is a long archive of work for many years.<br><br>
                Thank you :D<br>
